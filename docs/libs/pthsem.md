GNU pth is a user mode multi threading library. pthsem is a fork, with support for semaphores added. It can be installed parallel to a normal pth and provides a compatibilty layer to compile GNU pth programs with pthsem. The header file is called pthsem.h, the configuration programm pthsem-config and the autoconf macro AC_CHECK_PTHSEM. If references to one of these names are changed, pthsem can be used as an replacement of GNU pth.
